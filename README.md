mapreduce
=========

A somewhat simple implementation of MapReduce in Rust .11 to be used as a final excercise of a tutorial. <br>
Here is a much more complete version that was written in .8/.9: https://github.com/BinRoot/MapReduce-Rust <br>
A big thanks to the authors of that version, as it is giving me a lot of direction.
